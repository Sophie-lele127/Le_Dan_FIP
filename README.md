## Development and Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

To maintain organized development, we use the following naming convention for branches:

- **Design branches**:
  - `des.DL.home` - For Home Page design.
  - `des.DL.about` - For About Page design.
  - `des.DL.rooms` - For Rooms Page design.
  - `des.DL.booking` - For Reservations Page design.
- **Development branches**:
  - `dev.DL.home` - For Home Page development.
  - `dev.DL.about` - For About Page development.
  - `dev.DL.rooms` - For Rooms Page development.
  - `dev.DL.booking` - For Reservations Page development.

### Workflow

1. Work on design (`des.DL.<feature>`) first:
   - Finalize the layout and design using **CSS Grid**.
   - Ensure responsiveness for both mobile (412px) and desktop (1200px) views.
2. Transition to development (`dev.DL.<feature>`):
   - Integrate content and validate HTML/CSS.
3. Merge to the `main` branch after validation and testing.
